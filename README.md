# Reviewery iOS application

An iOS app that shows a list of selected Spotify playlists, and as a user you can rate songs from 0 to 10. Playlists are grouped by charts, so for example “Top 2017” chart consists of songs from “January 2017”, “February 2017” playlists and so on. Then it’s easy to sort
songs by rating and create your own “hit parade” of the year.
